     *   Parses a stream of data sent from the backend
     *
     *   To minimize bandwidth, traits/objects are not packed
     *   1-1; what arrives is an array of float values
     *
     *   For instance for:
     *   entity = (
     *        trait1 : 4,
     *        trait2 : 5,
     *        trait3 : 6,
     *    ) ...
     *
     *   what arrives will be:
     *       [...,4,5,6,...]
     *
     *   The traits are assumed to be variable in length,
     *   and the alorithm to decode them needs to the reverse
     *   of the algorithm that packed them on the backend
     *
     *   This is more convuluted than sending the JSON objects themselves,
     *   however these frames arrive multiple times per second. Even a naive
     *   packing reduces the packet size by ~50%, reducing how much needs to
     *   paid for network bandwith (and improving the quality & responsiveness
     *   of the application, since network latency is a major bottle-neck)
